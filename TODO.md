# Footer Revamp TODO

- [x] Update layout to a 4-column grid for better balance on larger screens
- [x] Change color scheme to dark theme (black background with white text)
- [x] Add a new "Quick Stats" section showing key metrics (e.g., projects completed, clients served)
- [x] Integrate a "Back to Top" button using the existing ScrollToTop component
- [x] Enhance animations with more subtle effects and stagger
- [x] Improve typography, spacing, and accessibility (e.g., better ARIA labels)
- [x] Test the component by running the app and checking responsiveness
- [x] Use browser to view the footer on different screen sizes
